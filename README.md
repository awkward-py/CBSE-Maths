## Unit-I: Relations and Functions

This unit covers relations, functions, and inverse trigonometric functions. Topics include types of relations, one-to-one and onto functions, and properties of inverse trigonometric functions.

## Unit-II: Algebra

In this unit, you'll explore matrices, determinants, and their applications. Learn about matrix operations, determinants of square matrices, and solving systems of linear equations using matrices.

## Unit-III: Calculus

This unit delves into topics related to continuity, differentiability, and applications of derivatives. You'll also explore integrals and their applications.

## Unit-IV: Vectors and Three-Dimensional Geometry

Learn about vectors, scalars, and their properties. This unit also covers three-dimensional geometry, including direction cosines and ratios.

## Unit-V: Linear Programming

Discover linear programming, optimization, and the graphical method of solving problems in two variables. Learn about feasible and infeasible regions, as well as optimal solutions.

## Unit-VI: Probability

This unit introduces probability theory, conditional probability, independent events, and probability distributions. Gain insights into random variables and their mean.
